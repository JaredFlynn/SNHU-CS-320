How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
The best way to ensure my code is functional and secure is by following industry standards and best practices. Creating tests based on the system requirements and frequent testing also ensures the code is functional. Ensuring that functional tests are created is also important.
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
When meeting with the client and establishing what the requirements for their system are it is important to understand the client’s overall intention with their system and who their end users will be. The client may not be familiar with the development process so it is also important to clearly identify the priority of specific requirements to ensure the overall system will function with a set of basic requirements. Generating mock-ups for the client is also another way to help them understand how their requirements are being met within the specific system.
How do I approach designing software?
My approach to designing software is to clearly identify the requirements, set timelines for specific tasks, and establish an organized method for accomplishing each task. Essentially, I take an agile approach to software development. I feel like agile methodologies are a better overall approach to the SDLC and can be implemented at any level of development whether it’s big industry or at my home doing a hobby project.
